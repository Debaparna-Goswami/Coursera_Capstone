    "Arizona and Hawaii- both the states in the United States of America have \"state of the art\" telescopes and observatories. As a grad student who wants to pursue a PhD in Astronomy, these giant visible-light range telescopes are subjects of fascination. For this capstone project, I'll explore the neighborhoods of Hawaii as well as Arizona and cluster the neighborhoods to show similarities and dissimilarities between these two places. \n",

    "Hopefully, students, faculty members and job-seeking candidates who want to work at the observatories of either of the mentioned places will be benefitted from this project as they will be able to make decisions about whether to stay near this place or travel from a further location, based on their preferences."
